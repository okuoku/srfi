Scheme Requests for Implementation (SRFIs) for R6RS
---------------------------------------------------

A basic framework for SRFIs made into R6RS libraries.  They live under the
`(xitomatl srfi ---)' library namespace (which is Derick's and is used here for
lack of thinking of a different one to use).  There is a registry of available
SRFIs which works alongside SRFI-0 Feature-Based Conditional Expansion.  The
porting done so far is mostly just taking the reference implementations from
http://srfi.schemers.org and wrapping them in libraries and tweaking the few
things needed to make them work in R6RS libraries and with implementations'
functionality.  Supporting any R6RS implementation supporting the *.IMPL.sls
convention is easy.  The ports and the framework started as just an exercise
in using R6RS.  If you have other ideas, let's see if we can collaborate.

NOTE: You might need to place the srfi/ directory in a directory named
"xitomatl" so your R6RS implementation(s) will be able to locate these
libraries.  The xitomatl/ directory can be empty.  This collection of
libraries has no dependencies on other libraries (other than `(rnrs)'
and other implementation-internal libraries).

These SRFIs are available:
  SRFI-0:  (xitomatl srfi cond-expand)
  SRFI-1:  (xitomatl srfi lists)
  SRFI-2:  (xitomatl srfi and-let*)
  SRFI-6:  (xitomatl srfi string-ports)
  SRFI-8:  (xitomatl srfi receive)
  SRFI-9:  (xitomatl srfi records)
  SRFI-11: (xitomatl srfi let-values)
  SRFI-13: (xitomatl srfi strings)
  SRFI-14: (xitomatl srfi char-set)
  SRFI-16: (xitomatl srfi case-lambda)
  SRFI-19: (xitomatl srfi time)
  SRFI-23: (xitomatl srfi error-reporting)
  SRFI-26: (xitomatl srfi cut)
  SRFI-27: (xitomatl srfi random)
  SRFI-31: (xitomatl srfi rec)
  SRFI-37: (xitomatl srfi args-fold)
  SRFI-38: (xitomatl srfi sharing)
  SRFI-39: (xitomatl srfi parameters)
  SRFI-41: (xitomatl srfi streams)
  SRFI-42: (xitomatl srfi eager-comprehensions)
  SRFI-43: (xitomatl srfi vectors)
  SRFI-48: (xitomatl srfi format)
  SRFI-61: (xitomatl srfi general-cond)
  SRFI-67: (xitomatl srfi compare)
  SRFI-78: (xitomatl srfi lightweight-testing)

If you already have ported SRFIs to R6RS, we'd love to assimilate them.  You
can let us know by "asking a question" at the Ikarus Libraries project page:
